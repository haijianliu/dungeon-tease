# Dungeon Tease

I have been working on a personal rendering engine these days. Although there are lots needed to deal with and it is really just a beginning, finally here comes the first tease! :tada:

<img src="https://github.com/HaijianLiu/circle-turbulence-glsl/blob/master/CircleTurbulenceA%402x.gif" width="600">

## Features

Features currently supported:

- `PBR` real time physics base rendering algorithm and HDR.
- `render queue` a node based render queue, that contributes to performance by reducing api calls.
- `render pass` separated render pass, such as G-buffer, effect, lighting, shadow, making the whole process more controllable and also contributing to rendering performance.
- `frustum culling` cull everything that is not inside the camera.
- `shadow mapping` real time shader based shadow mapping.
- `SSAO` real time screen-space SSAO.
- `particles system` better looking and performance, easy to implement.
- `instance object` implement of OpenGL instance draw feature.
- `ECS` Entity Component & GameObject System just like Unity Engine.
- `motion blending` bone animation blending, supporting all the animations from mixamo.com.
- `third person controller` player-camera controller just like all the third person game, supporting PS4 controller.
- `import blender file` blender is an awesome software. All the stages were edited in blender.

And some new features are one the way, such like `baked shadow and lighting` `LUT filter` `bloom and blur`.

## Download
- Source code available on GitHub (without assets).
- Download this demo here. (Password required && OSX 10.12 or later && PS4 controller).

## Frameworks

- `OpenGL ES 3.2 & GLM` Core graphic api and core math library.

- `Assimp` Although I have wrote some model loader program by myself, Assimp is more professional library and can handle more complex situations. [Open Asset Import Library (short name: Assimp)](http://assimp.sourceforge.net) is a portable Open Source library to import various well-known 3D model formats in a uniform manner.

- `stb` Public domain C image loading library by [nothings](http://nothings.org).

## Assets

- Character and animation from [mixamo](https://www.mixamo.com).
- Model by SilverTm from [UE4 Marketplace](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace).
